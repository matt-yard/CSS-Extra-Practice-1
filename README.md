# CSS-Extra-Practice

Before getting stareted:
*Please install the live server extension by Ritwick Dey for vscode to run the demo.*
*Please review the documentation provided on the CSS box model*
1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model
2. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp

This practice will walk you through various CSS implementations.

*Exercise one: Compose valid element-level CSS in an HTML file*
Element-level CSS refers to the utilization of CSS directly on the object the style is being applied to.

*Here is the checklist for this portion of the demo:*
    1.	Change the color of the h1 element to be red
    2.	Change the position of the h1 element to be centered
    3.	Change the color of the h2 element to be green
    4.	Change the position of the h2 tag to rightmost of the page
    5.	Create a grid of 9 boxes 3 across
    6.	Evenly distribute the space on each row between the 3 boxes
    7.	Create black boarders on each box
    8.	Round the corners on all boxes
    9.	Add an h1 Text field to each box
    10.	Add an X or O to each box to simulate a game of tic tac toe.
    11.	Change the boarders of the winning three boxes to red
    12.	Add a text field below the game to indicate the winner of the simulated game.
    13.	Take a screenshot of the index.html for submission



*Exercise two: Compose valid CSS in an HTML file's style tag in the head*
CSS utilizes selectors to identify a specific object or category of objects to apply styling to. These selectors include tag, class, id and class. For this exercise we are going to use certain selectors to change the CSS of the elements in our demo page. 
The advantage of a style component over element level styling is that rules can be applied to multiple elements while being defined once. With element level styling it is necessary to add CSS to each element individually which can be advantageous in some situations but is generally not considered best practice.

*Here is the checklist for this portion of the demo:*
    1.	Create a style element within the head of the html file to handle CSS
    2.	Move the element level CSS to the Style element
    3.	Take a screenshot of the index.html for submission
    4.	Move on when the page styling achieved with element level CSS is now achieved using a style element


*Exercise three: Compose valid CSS in an external CSS file, and include it via a link tag*
While using a style element to keep all styling rules in a single location as the number of rules increases this element will also increase. For cleanliness of code and readability it is better to keep CSS in a separate file and link to it in the html file.

*Here is the checklist for this portion of the demo:*
    1.	Create a style.css file in the demo
    2.	Move CSS from the style element to the style.css file
    3.	Link to the style.css file in the html file 
    4.	Move on when the page styling achieved with element level CSS is now achieved using the linked style file

*Exercise four: Apply an understanding of the box model to plan and implement CSS styling.*
